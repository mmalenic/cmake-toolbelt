cmake-toolbelt
**************

A small collection of CMake build code which adds some missing functionality and reduces repetitive build
configurations.

This repository contains a C23 `#embed`_ replacement, functions for better dependency management, utilities for
defining required args and enums, and combinator functions for |check_command| commands.

Usage
=====

To use this library, you can use CMake's |fetch_content| to import the project. All library
commands are available after including with a :cmake:`toolbelt_` prefix:

..
   x-release-please-start-version

.. code-block:: cmake

   include(FetchContent)

   # Fetch content from this repo.
   FetchContent_Declare(
        toolbelt
        GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/mmalenic/cmake-toolbelt
        GIT_TAG v0.3.3
   )
   FetchContent_MakeAvailable(toolbelt)

   # Allow cmake to find the src directory.
   list(APPEND CMAKE_MODULE_PATH "${toolbelt_SOURCE_DIR}/src")
   include(toolbelt)

..
   x-release-please-end

Alternatively, copy and paste the code in the `src`_ directory
and include the library using :cmake:`include(toolbelt)`.

Why does this project exist?
============================

The motivation behind this project is to define a common set of CMake functions that I use for a variety of C++
projects.

There are countless CMake "helper"-style libraries. See a list of some of the `here`_.
This project does not aim to replace these, however it does contain some code which existing libraries lack,
such as interactions with the CMake |check_command| commands.

Development
===========

This project contains a set of unit tests for the :cmake:`toolbelt` commands. These can be run using `pytest`_ and
`poetry`_. After initializing the poetry project, run the tests using pytest:

.. code-block:: shell

   pytest

The documentation for this project (including this README) is made using `sphinx`_, and published to github pages.
To generate documentation, run the following in the `docs`_ directory to create a static page:

.. code-block:: shell

   make html

Run the following to update this ``README.md``:

.. code-block:: shell

   make readme

Contributions are welcome. Feel free to open any pull requests or issues.
